# finalAssignment / SlutProjekt

##### The technologies used for this project :

- HTML5 & CSS: Barely worth mentioning. 
- Bootstrap: Was used to create a responsive menu bar and it was also used to make a clean grid system with rows and columns making the structure slick and organized.
- Jquery: Animation for the form labels. DOM manipulation by adding parapraphs and headers on button click or pressing enter. Scroll animation to different locations on the website from the menu navigation. Event driven validation of the amount of points in a form. Jquery was also used to manipulate CSS, adding classes and changing the appearence.
- Javascript: Add a bar chart with belong values from the users input in the form. Checking the total amount of numbers in form to make sure the amount is correct.


#####  Workflow : 

I developed the website mobile first which i believe is the right way for me to develop for the web. Especially nowadays when people mainly use their mobile phone to browse the internet. I also like the workflow of working with mobile first and the way of working with media queries in an acsending order. The workflow that I prefer is first make a simple wireframe in illustrator. This helps a lot to visualize how the website will look. After that it's time to make the structure in HTML5 to create the barebones for the website with some very simple design. Then develop the functionality that is needed and in the end focus mainly on the design to make it look good which usually includes working with both the structure (HTML) and CSS.  


#### Conclusion : 

My conclusion of what I did well in this project is the responsiveness. Any screen size works well. Also the javascript code is nicely divided into functions. The design turned out nice and the color combination works well. 

However, what can be improved for my next project is adding more complex functionality, better use of the HTML5 tags and i would like to make a better way to handle updating the form when the user has given the right amount of points (instead of only cancel the focus of the input field).
